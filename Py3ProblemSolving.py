# You have a 3 and a 5 litre water container, each 
# container has no markings except for that which 
# gives you it's total volume. You also have a running 
# tap. You must use the containers and the tap in such 
# away as to exactly measure out 4 litres of water. 

# How is this done?
















# There are 9 coins, all except one are the same weight, 
# the odd one is heavier than the rest. You must determine 
# which is the odd one out using an old fashioned balance. 
# You may use the balance twice. Explain how this can be done.
